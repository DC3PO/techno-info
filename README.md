# technoinfo

This was a website I created from scratch using HTML5 and CSS3.  The website is all about techno; where you can find clubs, listen to new tracks, artist info, and more.

The tracks are being pulled in from SoundCloud using an embedded player.

The forms are currently not linked to anything.

This site is currently not live.
