# technoinfo

This was a website I created from scratch using HTML5 and CSS3.  The website is all about techno; where you can find clubs, listen to new tracks, artist info, and more.

I used the "framework" from Learn How to Code HTML & CSS with Shay Howe.

The tracks are being pulled in from SoundCloud using an embedded player.

The forms are currently not linked to anything.

This site is currently not live.
